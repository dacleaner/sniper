Issues/Bugs/Enhancements Section:
---------
sniper.sh
---------
Issue/Bugs
1)none


Speed Ideas to consider:
1) nmap -sV - how is speed?   needs to thread and run mult hosts at a time..   (bc we are breaking down by 1 host)
2) a few msfconsole auxiliary's instead of nessuscmd for OS detection and login

Coding Neatness to consider:
1) use functions and classes and get rid of the duplicative coding
2) sometype of debug mode -v -vv
3) make compatabile with python 3.x  (now only python 2.7)
4)convert all python.sh  to python.py  (Vince is working on this part)


Enhancements to consider:
1)Need place to store dn_nmap -oA archived.nmap.results.blah blah (see rawr code to find the .xml results in tmp directory)
2) cred database functionality
(need to think about the security aspect - storing password for assessment in clear text..?  maybe a you ok with this?
(Tie in with something relating to the nessuscmd --sshi  --wmii thingy
run a "cred -a command to add any *VALID* creds recieved from ssh login,etc"  
maybe cred -a [IPaddress] -t password -p 22 -u [user] -P [pass]  
3)remove local eth0/eth1 ip address from msfdatabase results

=============================
(-)(BETA partial working)-- Nessus automation
= after kicking off the nessus scan --> import the nessus scans ...
(see sniper.sh  and ./tools/sniper.rb) (ben said teamsploit waits for this so look at his code)
msfconsole> load sniper
---??nessus_report_list (periodically make sure nothing running)
nessus_report_get 897ad439-1113-6af6-d701-c50dd2849d8fdcd56a59bef6527f
=========================
(-)(BETA - partially working)--GAPING HOLES found by msf compatable nessus plugins?
This code and ideas are in the MAGIC CVE section of sniper.sh and within cve_update in sniper.py
===============================
(-)(new code)--gaping HOLE from darkoperator finding??
see here -->  #~/scripts/sniper/third-party-tools/auto_exploit*
setup git to get new stuff from darkoperator
# msf> load auto_exploit
# msf> vuln_exploit -m
#   <here's your gaping holes?>
# msf> unload auto_exploit ### for safety
====================================


----------------
sniper.py
--------------
(-) Convert to python3, change dependency ,etc

(-) Phase X - report findings section
=detect 3.2.1.42 GEN001120 - FAIL rshd.config
=detect 3.2.1.38 GEN001020 - FAIL & root <> console
=plugin 38153, good summary of missing patches(but has to use nessucmd cuz msf db_import doesn't capture)
=how to check last bigfix update done ? 1)NASL like EPO?  2)nessucmd- policy like custom wireshark -> get file -> etc
=maybe id=35730 not ilke %virtual% -- helps find USB devices which could show up as unapproved USB devices?

(-) Confirm credential issues
(need to test all combinations and list definitively)
=good vs not good ssh - if 11936 and method = ssh, then good  (note 21745 is false positive)
=plugin 21745 - cred problem - (works win2k8R2 (UAC enabled) what does it do in linux ssh
=plugin 24786 - you logged in, but without administrator priv's
=???X)possibly something to be smarter about credential issues  (use nasl -t IP ./third-pary/nessus/smbshell.nbin)

(-)Resurect or kill once and for all the commented out Phase 6 which I removed (services)


---------
Future (Low Priority - if any)
---------
Do some logic for Account Credential issues
=1)See parse_nessus_xml.v19.pl  (specifically in section where it lists accounts)
=2)NSS-10860 will get local accounts
=3)NSS-10399 will get domain accounts (may need to change nessus scan policy with ENDUID > 1200)


Monitoring Module
=1)kick off snort
=2)custom rules =  1)nessus-login failed  2)ssh unix plugin id = ########  or (WMI windows plugin id=#####)
=3)How to do this?  some type of "app is hung?" function
=4)Dest unreachable (enough lost) maybe use thresholding
=5)how todo alerts let user know?  bell taillog?
